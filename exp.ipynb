      "[COPD] observational studies show an association between reduced lung function and impaired cognition., cognitive dysfunction influences important health outcomes and is a precursor to dementia, but treatments options are currently very limited., attention has therefore focused on identifying modifiable risk factors to prevent cognitive decline and preserve cognition., our objective was to determine if lung function or risk of copd causes reduced cognitive function using mendelian randomization ( mr )., single nucleotide polymorphisms from genome wide association studies of lung function and copd were used as exposures., we examined their effect on general cognitive function in a sample of 132, 452 individuals., we then performed multivariable mr ( mvmr ), examining the effect of lung function before and after conditioning for covariates., we found only weak evidence that reduced lung function ( beta − 0. 002 ( se 0. 02 ), p - value 0. 86 ) or increased liability to copd ( − 0. 008 ( 0. 008 ), p - value 0. 35 ) causes lower cognitive function., mvmr found both reduced fev1 and fvc do cause lower cognitive function, but that after conditioning for height ( − 0. 03 ( 0. 03 ), p - value 0. 29 and − 0. 01 ( 0. 03 ) p - value 0. 62, for fev1 and fvc respectively ) and educational attainment ( − 0. 03 ( 0. 03 ) p - value 0. 33 and − 0. 01 ( 0. 02 ), p - value 0. 35 ) the evidence became weak., we did not find evidence that reduced lung function or copd causes reduced cognitive function., previous observational studies are probably affected by residual confounding., research efforts should focus on shared risk factors for reduced lung function and cognition, rather than lung function alone as a modifiable risk factor., the online version contains supplementary material available at 10. 1186 / s12890 - 021 - 01611 - 6.

      "[COPD] copd may lead to cognitive impairment or even dementia., however, the current conclusions are inconsistent with little evidence from prospective, large - sample studies., this study was designed to explore the association of copd with mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) and dementia risk based on a cohort study., all participants were from the chinese longitudinal health longevity survey ( clhls ) 2011 / 2012 waves., the follow - up survey was conducted in 2014 and the incidence of mci and dementia were recorded., during the 3 - year follow - up period, 712 new cases of mci and 83 new cases of dementia were diagnosed., the incidence of mci and dementia were higher in those with copd than those without copd at baseline., cox analysis showed that the hrs of copd for mci and dementia incidence were 1. 486 ( 95 % ci : 1. 207 - 1. 855 ) and 1. 896 ( 95 % ci : 1. 079 - 3. 330 ), respectively after adjusting for related covariates., for different baseline smoking status, those who were current smokers had the highest hrs of copd for mci and dementia., baseline copd was independently associated with increased risk of mci and dementia incidence among chinese elderly, and the association was more pronounced among those who were current smokers.
